<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name's Shadi, I'm a Web Developer from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

<p>I am passionate about this field when creating a website from the idea to the final project, 
it's like building an apartment and decorating it, and seeing what you have made at the final,
it's really amazing feeling.</p>

<p>So, I like to help new businesses create their websites to show their products and market it.</p>
